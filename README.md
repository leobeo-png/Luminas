Rhythm game controller development. <br>
[Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNHZUSEBsMY "Early Prototype")
---
## Components Used:
 - Raspberry Pi Pico
 - MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor x2
 - VL53L0X ToF Sensor x2
 - TCA9548 I2C Multiplexer
---
## Goals
 - Clean up the code, dividing them into seperate modules
 - Keep testing until no crashes/errors
 - Figure out cross hand blocking of the ToF (Optimal positioning, potentially need more sensors)
 - Design and make the PCB 
 - Reaserch and design the casing
--- 
## What I Learnt so Far 
 - HID (descriptors, how NKRO works)
 - PCB schematic designing
